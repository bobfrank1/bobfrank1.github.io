The <a href="http://clay.yale.edu">Computational Linguistics at Yale (CLAY) Lab</a>, directed by <a href="http://bobfrank1.github.io">Bob Frank</a>, is seeking to appoint an NSF-funded postdoctoral researcher. The researcher will take part in a research project exploring the viability of deep neural networks as models of natural language learning. The project aims to understand of the relationship between the inductive biases of neural networks and the constraints on syntax that generative linguists have taken to necessitate an innate language faculty, universal grammar. The postdoctoral researcher will have a significant role in shaping the specific research directions that they explore. The work will be conducted in collaboration with researchers from Yale University and New York University, and the postdoc will be involved in supervision of students working on the project. The initial appointment will be for one year, with the opportunity of extension for a second year. 

Applicants should have a publication record that includes work on the computational modeling of linguistic structure, processing or acquisition. They should also have some background in theoretical syntax. Practical and theoretical computational skills are expected, but no specific expertise in neural network modeling is necessary. Candidates should, however, be willing to commit to quickly getting up to speed in the practice of this kind of research. Finally, prior to beginning the position, applicants should have completed the requirements for their PhD in a relevant field (e.g., linguistics, computer science, psychology, or cognitive science).

To apply, submit <a href = "mailto: clay.postdoc@gmail.com">via email</a> the following materials: (i) a cover letter that briefly describes previous research accomplishments and areas of interests for future work, (ii) a current CV, and (iii) two representative pieces of research (links to on-line publications are sufficient). In the cover letter, please also include contact information for three references. 

The position is available immediately and the start date is flexible. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis as they are received until the position is filled.
