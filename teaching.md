This page includes to links to materials for my courses. Sadly, all of
this is buried behing a Yale firewall, but I hope to fix this in the future.


### Current Classes (AY 2019-2020)

- LING 116 / CGSC 216
[Cognitive Science of Language](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/54501)
<br>
The study of language from the perspective of cognitive science. Exploration of mental structures that underlie the human ability to learn and process language, drawing on studies of normal and atypical language development and processing, brain imaging, neuropsychology, and computational modeling. Innate linguistic structure vs. determination by experience and culture; the relation between linguistic and nonlinguistic cognition in the domains of decision making, social cognition, and musical cognition; the degree to which language shapes perceptions of color, number, space, and gender. â€‚

- LING 380/780
[Neural Networks and Linguistic Structure](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/54534)
<br>
An introduction to the computational methods associated with "deep learning" (neural network architectures, learning algorithms, network analysis). The application of such methods to the learning of linguistic patterns in the domains of syntax, phonology, and semantics. Exploration of hybrid architectures that incorporate linguistic representation into neural network learning.



### Past Classes

- LING 224/624
[Mathematics of Language](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/40421)
<br>
Study of formal systems that play an important role in the scientific study of language. Exploration of a range of mathematical structures and techniques; demonstrations of their application in theories of grammatical competence and performance including set theory, graphs and discrete structures, algebras, formal language, and automata theory. Evaluation of strengths and weaknesses of existing formal theories of linguistic knowledge.


- LING 225/625
[Computing Meanings](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/2953)
<br>
Introduction to mathematical and computational tools for assigning meanings to natural language sentences. Foundational skills for the development of formal models of human language syntax and semantics, and for practical applications of language technology such as text understanding and question-answering. Topics include syntactic structure and displacement, quantification and inference, and the dynamics of discourse.

- LING 227/627
[Language and Computation I](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/40422)
<br> 
Design and analysis of computational models of language. Topics
include finite state tools, computational morphology and phonology,
grammar and parsing, lexical semantics, and the use of linguistic
models in applied problems.

- LING 229/629 [Language and Computation II](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/13771/files)
<br>
Exploration of the computational and linguistic foundations of systems for natural language processing by computer. Theoretical and practical issues involved in the construction of such systems, for problems including parsing, semantic interpretation, and machine translation.
